							Second(?) season of the Grisaia trilogy, with the second game being a 60-minute special so that Grisaia no Rakuen will be the second season instead of the third... *sigh*. Welp. Depending on what people say over this episode, I /may/ decide to watch it. Interest rate is 1.5/5. Otherwise, I'll just wait until the VN is localised and released in English later this year (or early next year). Studio 8bit screwed over the Grisaia no Kajitsu adaption so hard, so I'm not very hopeful for this.

This doesn't look fairly promising, but the promotional poster looks good and the PV caught my interest, so meh, might as well try it out. I may end up dropping it if the first episode doesn't catch my attention.

							Uhhhhhhh, what's there to say about this one? A spin off of the Haruhi franchise, set in the Disappearance universe, with Nagato as the main character. No, I'm not expecting Haruhi season 3. This is classified as a rom-com, and it should be viewed as such. All of the sci-fi elements preset in previous Haruhi installations have been thrown out the window. Nevertheless, hopefully this comes out fairly desent, as my expectations are sadly, fairly low on this one. (Kyon, what the hell happened to your character design? D:)

							Plastic Memories is my most-looked-forward anime of this season. Why? The premise is similar to Chobits, it gives off the feel of romantic tragedy (those are to die for), and it's written by the writer of Chaos;Head, Steins;Gate, and Robotics;Notes. This and Fate/stay night have my highest expectations of this season, and hopefully their respective studios can deliver.

							This one is self explanatory if you are familiar with my tastes. The first installation of this trilogy, Grisaia no Kajitsu, is one of my favourite visual novels of all time. While Studio 8bit massively fucked up its anime adaption last Fall season, I have relatively high hopes for this 1 hour special due to the plotline's linear nature, unlike Kajitsu.
